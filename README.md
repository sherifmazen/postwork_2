Personal Expense Tracker Analysis
Overview
The goal of this project is to create a simple personal expense tracker using Python and Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook. By analyzing monthly expenses, users will gain insights into their spending habits and identify key areas where their money goes.

Key Tasks
Set up a dataset of fake monthly expenses with relevant columns (Date, Description, Category, Amount)

Use Pandas to create a DataFrame and ensure the Amount column is numeric

Conduct a simple analysis to calculate total expenses, spending by category, and identify the largest expense

Create a pie chart to visualize the spending breakdown by category

Summarize findings in a final text cell

Deliverables
A Jupyter Notebook containing:

A DataFrame of monthly expenses

Analysis results including total spent, spending by category, and the largest expense

A pie chart visualizing spending categories

A summary statement of findings

Acceptance Criteria
The DataFrame is correctly set up and displays all required columns

The Amount column is confirmed to be numeric

Total expenses are accurately calculated

Spending by category is correctly grouped and summed

The pie chart accurately represents the spending breakdown

The summary statement reflects the analysis findings
